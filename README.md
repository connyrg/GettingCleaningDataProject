### Introduction

This repository contains the R scipt run\_analysis.R which create a tidy dataset from a raw data on Human Activity Recognition using smartphones. 

### Repository Contents

1. README.md
2. CodeBook.md - the data dictionary of the output tidy dataset
3. run\_analysis.R - R script that takes the raw data and create a tidy dataset named summary\_measurement.txt

### Usage

1. Create a working directory.
2. Download the zipped raw data UCI HAR Dataset.zip from [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), and then unzipped it into the working directory. A folder named UCI HAR Dataset will be created in the working directory.
3. Saved the run_analysis.R into the working directory, and run the script using Base R or R Studio. The output tidy dataset named summary\_measurement.txt will be created in the working directory.
